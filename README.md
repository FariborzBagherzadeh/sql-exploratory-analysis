Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global layoffs dataset using MySQL, uncovering trends by company, country, year, and industry.

# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with MySQL

This project demonstrates how **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** can be performed directly in **MySQL**. Using a real-world layoffs dataset, the analysis uncovers trends across companies, countries, industries, and time.  

The focus is on leveraging **SQL queries**â€”including aggregations, grouping, and window functionsâ€”to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset Overview
The dataset includes global layoff records from 2020â€“2023.  
Key columns:
- `company` â€“ Company name  
- `location` â€“ Company headquarters  
- `industry` â€“ Industry type  
- `total_laid_off` â€“ Number of layoffs  
- `percentage_laid_off` â€“ Percentage of workforce laid off  
- `date` â€“ Date of layoff event  
- `stage` â€“ Company funding stage (e.g., Series B, Post-IPO)  
- `country` â€“ Country of company  
- `funds_raised_millions` â€“ Funding amount raised

## ðŸ”¹ Analysis Performed
1. **Dataset Exploration**
   - Preview of layoffs data.  
   - Identified data ranges (min/max layoff dates).  

2. **Company-Level Analysis**
   - Total layoffs per company.  
   - Company + year layoffs aggregation.  
   - Top 5 companies by layoffs each year (using window functions).  

3. **Country-Level Analysis**
   - Total layoffs per country.  
   - Ranking countries with the highest layoffs.  

4. **Time-Based Analysis**
   - Layoffs by year.  
   - Monthly layoffs trend.  
   - Rolling cumulative layoffs over time.

## ðŸ”¹ SQL Concepts Used
- `GROUP BY` and aggregations (`SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`)  
- Date functions (`YEAR()`, `SUBSTRING()`)  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window functions (`DENSE_RANK()`, `OVER()`)  
- Cumulative rolling totals  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example Insights
- Largest layoffs occurred in the US and India.  
- Peak layoff activity in 2022.  
- Certain companies consistently rank among the top 5 by layoffs.  
- Monthly layoffs trend shows spikes during specific economic downturns.

## ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated
- **MySQL** for data exploration  
- **SQL for analytics** (beyond basic CRUD)  
- **Data storytelling with queries**  
- Use of **window functions** for ranking and rolling totals
